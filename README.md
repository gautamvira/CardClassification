# CardClassification

A simple CNN classifier using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to predict card types from the [Kaggle Card Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification)

The parameters from the trained model are saved along with the configured optimizer in a `pth` file.
